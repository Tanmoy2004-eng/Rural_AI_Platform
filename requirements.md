## 1. Introduction

Rural communities face challenges related to limited access to information, inefficient resource utilization, climate uncertainty, and weak market linkages. This project aims to build an AI-powered platform that supports rural ecosystems by enabling sustainable agriculture, efficient resource management, and improved livelihood decision-making.

The solution will leverage artificial intelligence, data analytics, and low-bandwidth-friendly technologies to provide actionable insights to farmers, cooperatives, local businesses, and community organizations.
